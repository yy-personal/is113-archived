/*
In the last few weeks, we have been using Associative Arrays or Indexed Arrays
to represent and store “things” such as persons, books, fruits, students, etc.

For example,
  $cats is an Indexed Array where each cat is represented and stored as an Associative Array.
  The key is an attribute of a cat (e.g. name, age, gender, status).
